# How to Use the App

### 1. Update App Preferences

In order for the upload and clipboard copy to take place, you must ensure that the apps API URL is pointing to your server.

After starting the app it will show up in your menubar. Click the icon to display the menu:

### 2. Use Mac's Built-in Screen Capture Function

The app listens for screen captures on your mac. Simply use the standard screen capture tool. You can learn more about the built in Mac screen capture tool here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361

### 3. Capture is Clipboarded

Once the screen capture is automatically uploaded to your personal server, you will hear a gong sound. That means the upload is complete and the newly created image URL is now copied to your clipboard. You can paste it anywhere you'd like using CMD+V.
